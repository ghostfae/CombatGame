# CombatGame
A simple combat simulator with two teams of one or two combat units. These units fight until there is only one side remaining, using 'spells' (attack, heal) to win the battle. These spells can have extra effects (damage over time, freezing) and have crit chances for 4x damage.

## Usage
The program runs automatically with coded stats, requiring user input (any key) to progress to the next round. It keeps going until one side has achieved victory by wiping out the other team.

## Purpose
This is a personal project I have created as a fun way to build on my fundamental knowledge of C#, as well as learn how and why different patterns are used in practical code. It is inspired by turn-based RPGs, most notably Heroes of Might and Magic 3 as the units are automated instead of controlled. Pok√©mon and Final Fantasy-style games are also minor influences. I enjoy working with numbers and sums, so I wanted to work with calculating crit chances and the randomised damage amounts.

## Status
Unfinished. I would like to create a custom menu that allows the user to select the simulation parameters - ie. if each team has one unit or two, the classes of these units. I also want to expand the game with more classes and more types of attacks, and perhaps increase the team sizes.
