# CombatGame
A simple combat simulator with two teams of one or two combat units. These units fight until there is only one side remaining, using 'spells' (attack, heal) to win the battle. These spells can have extra effects (damage over time, freezing) and have crit chances for 4x damage.

## Purpose
This is a personal project I have created as a fun way to build on my fundamental knowledge of C#, as well as learn how and why different patterns are used in practical code. It is inspired by turn-based RPGs, most notably Heroes of Might and Magic 3 as the units are automated instead of controlled. Pok√©mon and Final Fantasy-style games are also minor influences. I enjoy working with numbers and sums, so I wanted to work with calculating crit chances and the randomised damage amounts.
